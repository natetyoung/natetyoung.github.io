I am a computer architect at AMD, working on AMD's machine learning inference architecture, XDNA, in the Artificial Intelligence Group. I work primarily on data movement programmability.

Before I came to AMD, I completed my MS in Computer Science at UC Berkeley in 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by John Wawrzynek, working on FPGA interconnect-CAD codesign and VLSI theory. Before that, I completed a BS in EECS in 2020, also at Berkeley.

I am interested in realistic models of computation, especially for accelerated and scalable computing. My goal is to understand computation by studying the fundamental possibilities and limits of how it can be performed.
